# zx402: Test Plan

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Status | v1.0, 2026-10-06 |
| Covers | Release M0 (mainnet canary) and the public frontend |
| Companions | [SPEC.md](./SPEC.md), [TEST-VECTORS.md](./TEST-VECTORS.md), [PLAN-M0.md](./PLAN-M0.md), [RUNBOOK-M0.md](./RUNBOOK-M0.md) |

Every rule in the Spec has at least one test that passes when the rule holds and one that fails when it is broken.
Test IDs are stable. Use them in test names, commit messages, and reviews.

## 1. Rules for writing these tests

- Write the failing test first. Watch it fail. Then write the code.
- A negative test must fail for the stated reason. Check the reason, not only the failure.
- Validator tests use real proofs as fixtures. A mocked verifier hides real bugs.
- Each negative validator test changes one thing from a passing transaction.
- Never weaken a test to make it pass. Fix the code or fix the Spec.

## 2. Layers

| Layer | Tool | Runs where | Network |
|---|---|---|---|
| Public frontend | Vitest, React Testing Library, browser checks | `apps/web` | None |
| Crypto library | Node test runner | `packages/crypto` | None |
| Circuits | circom, snarkjs, Node test runner | `circuits` | None |
| Validators | `aiken check` | `contracts` | None |
| Transaction builders | Node test runner, local script evaluation with the pinned Aiken | `packages/txlib` | None, with a fake chain |
| Services and SDK | Node test runner | `services/*`, `packages/sdk` | None, with a fake chain |
| Rehearsal | Node test runner, real HTTP, the stock x402 seller | `ops` | None, with a fake chain |
| End to end | The runbooks | Preprod first, then mainnet | Preprod, then mainnet with capped funds |

No pool UTXO exists on mainnet before deployment, so the transaction builder tests cannot evaluate against mainnet state.
They run against an in-memory chain and evaluate scripts locally. Evaluation through a mainnet provider is part of the runbook.

## 3. Crypto library (`CRY`)

| ID | Test | Source of truth |
|---|---|---|
| CRY-01 | `h1`, `h2`, `h3` match the known answers | TEST-VECTORS section 2 |
| CRY-02 | `ZERO_HASHES[0..32]` match, and `ZERO_HASHES[32]` is the empty root | TEST-VECTORS section 3 |
| CRY-03 | The note example gives the listed precommitment, commitment, and nullifier hash | TEST-VECTORS section 4 |
| CRY-04 | Tree roots and paths match for the one-leaf and two-leaf examples | TEST-VECTORS section 5 |
| CRY-05 | `labelFor` matches both label vectors | TEST-VECTORS section 6 |
| CRY-06 | `intentBytes` and `contextFor` match both context vectors | TEST-VECTORS section 7 |
| CRY-07 | `nullifierKey` gives 32 big-endian bytes for both vectors | TEST-VECTORS section 8 |
| CRY-08 | `proofToCardano` and `vkToCardano` give the listed compressed bytes | TEST-VECTORS section 9 |
| CRY-09 | Key derivation matches the known answers, is deterministic, and different indexes give different secrets | SPEC 4.7, TEST-VECTORS section 10 |
| CRY-10 | Every encoder rejects out-of-range input: amount of 2^64, index of 2^32, wrong hash length, pointer address | SPEC 4.8 |

## 4. Circuits (`CIR`)

One positive test per circuit, then one negative test per constraint. Numbers follow SPEC section 5.

| ID | Circuit | Test |
|---|---|---|
| CIR-P01 | all | Poseidon255 in circom equals the TypeScript library on the shared vectors |
| CIR-O01 | all | The generated public signal order file matches SPEC 5.1, 5.2, 5.3 |
| CIR-S00 | spend | A valid partial spend and a valid full spend both prove and verify |
| CIR-S01 | spend | A wrong `existingValue`, `label`, or secret breaks the commitment and fails |
| CIR-S02 | spend | A wrong state path or a wrong `stateRoot` fails |
| CIR-S03 | spend | A label that is not in the ASP tree fails |
| CIR-S04 | spend | `label = 0` fails, even with a path to an empty ASP leaf |
| CIR-S05 | spend | A `nullifierHash` that does not match the nullifier fails |
| CIR-S06 | spend | `withdrawnValue` above `existingValue` fails |
| CIR-S07 | spend | A value of 2^64 or more fails the range check |
| CIR-S08 | spend | A `newCommitment` with a wrong remaining value or label fails |
| CIR-S09 | spend | `newNullifier` equal to `existingNullifier` fails |
| CIR-S10 | spend | The same witness with a different `context` gives a proof that fails under the first context |
| CIR-I00 | insert | Valid batches prove: 1 note, 4 notes, 1 deposit, 4 deposits, 2 notes then 2 deposits |
| CIR-I01 | insert | A gap in the used slots fails. An empty slot 0 fails |
| CIR-I02 | insert | An empty slot with a non-zero `v` or `l` fails |
| CIR-I03 | insert | A note slot with a non-zero `v` fails |
| CIR-I04 | insert | A deposit `v` of 2^64 or more fails |
| CIR-I05 | insert | A deposit leaf that is not `H3(v, l, x)` gives a different root, so the claimed `newRoot` fails |
| CIR-I06 | insert | A path whose slot is not empty under the running root fails |
| CIR-I07 | insert | A wrong `startIndex` fails |
| CIR-I08 | insert | A wrong `newRoot` fails |
| CIR-R00 | ragequit | A valid proof verifies |
| CIR-R01 | ragequit | A wrong `value` or `label` fails |
| CIR-R02 | ragequit | A wrong path or root fails |
| CIR-R03 | ragequit | A wrong `nullifierHash` fails |

## 5. Verifier module (`VER`)

| ID | Rule | Test |
|---|---|---|
| VER-00 | V4 | Both proofs from TEST-VECTORS section 9 verify |
| VER-01 | V1 | A public input of `x + r` is rejected. A negative input is rejected |
| VER-02 | V2 | A point of the wrong length and the point at infinity are each rejected. Bytes that are not a valid point fail the script |
| VER-03 | V3 | One input too few and one input too many are each rejected |
| VER-04 | V4 | A tampered proof and a wrong public input are each rejected |
| VER-05 | V5 | A proof with a zero public input verifies, and the zero input costs no scalar multiplication |
| VER-06 | V6 | Verifying the 2-input vector costs at most 2.2B CPU. This fails when a curve point passes through an `Option` or a list |

## 6. On-chain encodings (`ENC`)

| ID | Test |
|---|---|
| ENC-01 | `label` in Aiken matches both label vectors |
| ENC-02 | `context` in Aiken matches both context vectors |
| ENC-03 | `nullifier_key` in Aiken matches both vectors |

| ENC-05 | `context` fails on an amount of 2^64 or more and on a datum hash that is not 32 bytes |

## 7. Pool validator (`POOL`)

Each ID is `POOL-` plus the rule number from SPEC 6.5. Each row is one negative test unless marked.

| POOL-S4 | `withdrawn` is 0 or 2^64, or `new_commitment` is 0, or an input is `x + r` |
| POOL-S5 | The pool ID in the intent is wrong, or the payout list is empty or has five entries |
| POOL-S6 | The context is computed from a different intent |
| POOL-S7 | The proof is invalid |
| POOL-S8 | The nullifier hash is already in the set, or the nullifier proof is wrong |

| POOL-S10 | A payout goes to another address, pays 1 lovelace less or more, has a wrong datum, or carries a reference script |
| POOL-S11 | Payouts plus the protocol fee exceed `withdrawn` |
| POOL-S12 | The pool balance falls by a wrong amount, or `fees_accrued` is wrong |
| POOL-S13 | The validity bound is missing or later than `valid_until` |

## 8. Other validators

| ID | Test |
|---|---|
| DEP-01 | Absorb fails when no input holds the pool NFT |

## 9. Budgets (`BUD`)

Each test asserts an upper bound on CPU and memory for a realistic worst case.

| ID | Transaction | CPU bound | Memory bound |
|---|---|---|---|
| BUD-01 | Settle with 4 payouts, queue at 7, trie proof for one million entries | 3.5B | 2.5M |

| BUD-03 | Insert with 4 notes | 3.3B | 1.5M |
| BUD-04 | Ragequit | 3.2B | 2.5M |

If a bound cannot be met, change the Spec estimate first, then the bound.

## 10. Transaction builders (`TX`)

| ID | Test |
|---|---|
| TX-01 | Init builds, balances, and creates the three UTXOs with the genesis datums |
| TX-02 | Deposit builds a plain payment with the inline `DepositDatum` |
| TX-03 | Refund builds and needs only the refund key |
| TX-04 | Insert builds for notes, for deposits, and for a mix, and evaluates within budget |
| TX-05 | Settle builds with 1 and 4 payouts, sets the validity bound, and evaluates within budget |
| TX-06 | Ragequit builds and requires the refund key signature |
| TX-07 | CollectFees, config update, and ASP update build and evaluate |
| TX-08 | No pool transaction contains a mint, a withdrawal, or a certificate |
| TX-09 | The stealth leg-2 payment has one input, one output, and a fee equal to input minus price |

## 11. Services and SDK

| ID | Test |
|---|---|
| IDX-01 | The indexer rebuilds leaves, labels, nullifiers, and pool state from recorded chain data |
| IDX-02 | Leaf order equals insertion order, and the rebuilt root equals the on-chain root |
| IDX-03 | A rollback removes the rolled-back entries and restores the previous state |
| CRK-01 | The crank triggers on the conditions in SPEC 8.3 |
| CRK-02 | The crank builds a correct batch of queued notes, then deposits |
| CRK-03 | The crank skips deposits that Insert would reject |
| REL-01 | A quote covers payouts, the protocol fee, and the relayer fee |
| REL-02 | A settle with a valid proof is built and submitted |
| REL-03 | A settle with an invalid proof or a mismatched intent is refused before building |
| REL-04 | A stale state root or ASP root returns the matching error code |
| REL-05 | When another party spends the pool UTXO first, the relayer rebuilds and submits again |
| REL-06 | Two settles chain inside one block window |
| SDK-01 | All notes are recovered from the seed plus indexer data |
| SDK-02 | Sync downloads leaves in pages and never sends a commitment to the server |

| SDK-04 | The stealth signer returns a valid x402 payload whose nonce is the one-time UTXO |
| SDK-05 | The SDK refuses to prove when the approved set is under the threshold |
| SDK-06 | The SDK proves again after `stale_root` or `stale_asp_root` |
| SDK-07 | The SDK rejects a payout below the minimum ADA and a pointer address before proving |
| SDK-08 | The SDK spends the larger note when two notes share a nullifier |
| MON-01 | The solvency monitor raises an alert when a fake discrepancy is injected |

## 12. End to end on mainnet (`E2E`)

`E2E-01` to `E2E-17` are the steps of [RUNBOOK-M0.md](./RUNBOOK-M0.md), in order. Each step lists its pass check there.
[RUNBOOK-PREPROD.md](./RUNBOOK-PREPROD.md) runs the same steps on the test network with the exact commands.

### Rehearsal on the local chain

`ops/test/rehearsal.test.ts` plays runbook steps 4 to 13 on the local chain: deploy, the node, the stock x402 seller, and the demo, through real HTTP.
Its cases reuse four IDs for what they check:

| ID in the rehearsal | What it checks |
|---|---|
| E2E-01 | The seller answers HTTP 200 and holds exactly its price. No transaction that pays the seller touches the wallet. The HTTP traffic of the node holds no note secret. |
| E2E-02 | The exit returns the rest. The pool ends with its reserve plus fees. |
| E2E-03 | A second run on the same chain and store works. |
| E2E-04 | The node keeps running when one round fails. |

### Admin actions (`ADM`)

| ID | Test | Where |
|---|---|---|
| ADM-01 | Pause and unpause through a config update. A missing admin signature fails. A value outside the bounds is refused. | `packages/txlib/test/admin.test.ts` |
| ADM-02 | Fee collection pays the treasury and lowers the pool by exactly the amount. More than the accrued fees is refused. | same file |
| ADM-03 | During a pause an Insert of a deposit fails, and a Settle still confirms. | same file |
| OPS-ADM-01 to 03 | The admin command: pause twice, no fees to collect, and a sweep that takes only this pool's reference outputs. | `ops/test/admin.test.ts` |

## 13. Invariant coverage

| Invariant | Tests |
|---|---|
| INV-1 Solvency | POOL-I11, POOL-S12, POOL-R7, POOL-C4, MON-01 |
| INV-2 No double spend | POOL-S8, POOL-R6, VER-01, ENC-03 |
| INV-3 Tree integrity | POOL-I8, POOL-I9, POOL-S15, CIR-I06, CIR-I07, CIR-I08 |
| INV-4 Value binding | POOL-I5, CIR-I05 |
| INV-5 Spend validity | CIR-S01 to CIR-S09, POOL-S7 |
| INV-6 Intent binding | POOL-S6, POOL-S10, CIR-S10, ENC-02 |
| INV-7 Exit liveness | POOL-R0, E2E-12, CRK-01 |
| INV-8 Isolation | DEP-01, DEP-03, POOL-P3 |
| INV-9 Immutability | Review of deployed script hashes against the manifest |
| INV-10 Bounded admin | CFG-01, CFG-02, CFG-03, POOL-I2 |

## 14. Public frontend (`FE`)

These checks cover SPEC 8.10. Run automated checks with `npm test` from the repo root.

| ID | Test |
|---|---|
| FE-01 | The landing page renders its sections, `In development` status, ADA-first scope, and the default privacy facts: note secrets stay on the agent's machine; the relayer gets a proof and an intent |
| FE-02 | Every `Read docs` link targets `/docs/` |
| FE-03 | Mobile navigation opens and closes with accessible controls; Escape closes it and returns focus to the trigger; selecting an anchor closes it |
| FE-04 | The How it works overview presents Deposit, Prove locally, and Pay together on first render with the full funding path and no step-selection interaction |
| FE-05 | FAQ items disclose and hide their answers with keyboard controls |
| FE-06 | The documentation reader displays current PRD, SPEC, and PLAN-M0 source with working topic navigation |
| FE-07 | Manual browser check: scrolling forward and back moves the character scene, intro word contrast, and illustrations; headings and cards reveal in a stagger; desktop and mobile layouts have no horizontal overflow or characters obscuring content; native scroll and anchor links work; navigation, payment orbit, FAQ, and docs work with a keyboard; focus reveals its content; reduced motion disables decorative animation |
| FE-08 | Scroll updates decorative transforms and intro word contrast; `Pause motion` freezes those transforms and reveals all content; resuming applies the current scroll position |
| FE-09 | Reduced motion shows a static, readable layout and disables JavaScript scroll animation listeners; changing the preference while the page is open updates the behavior; missing motion APIs or observers leave content visible |
| FE-10 | Unmounting cleans up motion listeners, observers, and pending animation frames; remounting starts one working set without duplicate updates |
| FE-11 | The hero exposes the unchanged readable headline to assistive technology. Pointer entry never replaces the word. Smoke layers are decorative. Manual browser checks cover flat readable type, drifting smoke that disperses on hover, touch behavior, pause, and reduced motion without layout shift or overflow |
| FE-12 | The payment path starts with a dotted ring, reveals six nodes in order, dims prior nodes, and moves the detail card beside the active node. A shared later scroll interval flips the center portrait into the zBase mark and all six nodes into portrait variants at once. The outer ring and nodes turn together while portraits stay upright. The sequence reverses with scroll and stays pinned through completion. Keyboard focus and selection reveal the matching explanation and hold until another scroll stage. Pause, reduced motion, missing APIs, and scenes too large to pin keep all six manual controls and readable content. Unmounting removes listeners, observers, and frame callbacks. Manual browser checks verify moving cards stay clear of the centered ring, dimmed nodes remain opaque over the dotted line, the flip sequence, and mobile layout without overflow |
| FE-13 | The footer groups working Explore and Resources links, retains the development status, and uses the local Read docs destination |
| FE-14 | The payment overview shows all three steps and diagrams without scroll or click. It explains the shared ADA pool, local note secrets, proof and intent sent to the relayer, and a one-time key paying the x402 seller. It remains complete with reduced motion and missing motion APIs, installs no scroll animation listeners, and has no pinned scene or progressive content. Observer checks verify visible-card activation, offscreen pausing, and cleanup. Manual checks verify the softly feathered Soffit background, large high-contrast diagrams and logos, ordered desktop diagram sequence, independent phone loops, shared pause control, and a readable layout with reduced motion |
| FE-15 | The privacy boundary distinguishes local note secrets from the proof and intent sent to the relayer. Public amounts, recipients, and timing remain explicit. The privacy model link has a working destination. The visual fits desktop and mobile without hiding its explanation |
| FE-16 | Manual visual asset check: the hero and payment orbit use nine soft stylized companion portraits with rounded shapes, simple friendly faces, and muted lavender, sage, blue, charcoal, and ivory clothing. Variants remain recognizable at desktop and phone sizes. The scenic footer uses a matching friendly companion and rounded landscape in muted lavender and slate tones with a warm twilight glow. Desktop and phone crops keep the companion visible and the invitation readable. Existing character motion, footer parallax, pause, and reduced motion behavior remain intact, and artwork does not obscure text |
| FE-17 | The Soffit renderer uses the approved muted mint palette with no bright corner glow and the supplied motion parameters. It draws one triangle with DPR capped at 1, pauses offscreen, in hidden tabs, and under the shared pause or reduced motion setting. No-WebGL and lost-context cases preserve a static backdrop and readable content. Resize and unmount release listeners, observers, frames, and GPU resources. Browser checks verify the actual shader, pointer response, soft edge fade, and desktop and phone legibility |
| FE-18 | Manual visual icon check: every landing section uses the refined custom geometric SVG family. Diagram pictograms have distinct crisp silhouettes, clear negative space, and flat muted lavender, sage, and charcoal fills. Icons have no gradients, highlights, drop shadows, faces, or toy-like details. The `Your agent` node in How it works is the exception: it uses an existing companion portrait with a clean crop and readable label. Other icons retain the flat geometric style. Small custom rounded controls remain clear at their displayed size. The zBase and Cardano marks remain recognizable. Desktop and phone layouts keep icons and the agent portrait legible on dark and mint backgrounds without clipping or overflow. The payment orbit, overview, and privacy boundary retain their meaning. Decorative icons stay hidden from assistive technology, and navigation, FAQ, links, and motion controls retain their accessible names and keyboard behavior. Existing animation and pause behavior remain intact, with no new icon motion |
